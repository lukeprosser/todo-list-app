# ToDo List App
This web app is an interactive to-do list tool that enables the user to record, check off and delete tasks.

The main purpose of this project was to develop my skills in jQuery (including setting, getting and manipulating elements in the DOM), as well as draw together techniques from HTML and CSS in conjunction.

<ul>
    <li>Fully interactive interface</li>
